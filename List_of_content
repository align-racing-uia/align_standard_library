classes: 

    == CANbus ==

        This class is a simplification of the mcp2515 library. 
        It takes care of sending and receiving CANbus-messages, ass well as error handling.

        Constructor: 
            Sets the communication pin to the CANbus chip.
            Sets the CANbus options to the default. (normal mode, bitrate to 500KBPS, disabled error messages)

        Functions:
            setBitrate()            | Used to sett the bitrate for the CANbus chip. Default: 500KBPS.
            sendMessageOnce()       | Sends a canMessage-object as a CANbus message once.
            sendMessageRepeating()  | Adds a message to the list of messages that will be sent repeatedly.
            update()                | Must run repeatedly in the program. Is used to look for messages on the CANbus network and sends all messages that send repeatedly.
            addReciver()            | Used to link local variables to designated CANbus messages.
            enableErrorMessages()   | Enables the system to send error message. Default: disabled.
            setErrorCanID()         | Used to specify the CANbus id of the error messages. Default: 0xFF
            newError()              | Creates and sends a new error message.






    == canMessage ==

        This class is a dynamic simplification of the can_frame struct in the mcp2515 library
        It is used to store variables in a format that is easy to convert to CANbus messages

        Constructor:
            Creates an empty can_frame and sets the CANbus id

        Functions:
            add()                   | Adds a variabel in to the CANbus message
            setTimeIntervall()      | Sets the time intervall for messages that is sendt repeetdly. Default 100 ms
            getMessage()            | Returns the pointer of the CANbus message





    == sensor ==

        This class serves as a basic setup for reading values of an analogue sensor.
        It takes care of mapping, implausibility check and reading intervals.

        Constructor:
            Takes inn a pin for reading values and sets all values to default.
            Can also be linked to a canMessage object for storing data directly.

        Functions:
            setMapMinMax()          | Sets the minimum and maxumum for the linear maping. 0V = min and 5V = max. Default min = 0 and max = 50.
            setImpMinMax()          | Sets the bounderys for implosebil signals. An error message is also sent if an 
                                      implausible signal is detected and error messages are enabled. This functionality is default disabled.
            addErrorMsg()           | Allows for error messages to be sent.
            setReadingInterval()    | Sett the interval of reading sensor data. Default 0 ms.
            read()                  | Reads the sensor values and checks for implausibility if implausibility check is enabled
            getData()               | Returns the newest reeding of the sensor.
